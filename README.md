**Content**
This course is an introduction to Computational Psycholinguistics, an interdisciplinary field of
study which combines the study of human language processing with computational linguistics.
The course will survey major research areas and questions in the scientific study of language
processing and acquisition in humans and machines, combining symbolic and probabilistic
approaches. The course will cover topics such as grammar formalisms, language models,
empirical research methodologies, cognitive theory of language processing, and language and
the brain.

Project and HW based course. Instructions for the project and each assigment is attached.
